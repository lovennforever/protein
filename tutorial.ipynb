    " ## Background\n",
    "Change in free energy is a very important physical quantity that determines the direction of many biological processes. For instance, the solubility of a molecule in a solvent is determined by the solvation free energy - a change in free energy when taking a solute molecule from vacuum into the solvent. Binding free energy is very important when investigating the binding affinity of ligands (or drugs) to a specific binding site on the receptor. In this tutorial we will learn how to use one of the most popular approaches to evaluate difference in free energy of two states - alchemical free energy evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will focus on the free energy of solvation for a small molecule (ethanol), but similar procedures are used to calculate binding free energy. We will start with some background on how the free energies can be calculated in molecular dynamics simulations, and how the evaluation of free energy of solvation is one of the steps, necessary to calculate free energy of binding. Then, we will focus on the practicalities of doing such a calculation in GROMACS."

    "Assume that we need to compute the difference in free energy of two states $A$ and $B$. Let us also assume that $A$ and $B$ are well separated in the phase space and direct comparison between them is problematic. The trick then is to construct a set of intermediate states that are close to one another in the phase space. The proximity of the states allows one to compare them directly, computing the free energy difference between two consequent intemediate states. Then, going from one state to another, one can complete the full path between the states $A$ and $B$ and the sum of the differences between consequentive intermediate states will give the difference in free energies between $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to calculate the binding free energy of the ligand to a receptor, we ultimately need to compare the state, where the ligand is bound to the receptor, to the state where both the ligand and the receptor are separated in solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ligand-binding.png](./images/ligand-binding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be calculated directly, for example by slowly dragging the ligand away from the receptor and computing the dependence of average force between them. If the system will have enough time to explore all possible states while the ligand is pulled away, the integral of the force over the distance will give the free energy profile (usually called potential of mean force). However, the simulation times needed for convergence of this method are usually very long and when convergence is not reached, the fluctuations in forces can be very large. This makes the potential of mean force methods much more expensive than using *free energy perturbation* or *alchemical free energy computation* methods such as the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) that we’ll use in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that a free energy difference between two states $A$ and $B$ ($F_B - F_A$) determines their relative probability $p_A$ and $p_B$,\n",
    "$$ \\frac{p_A}{p_B} = exp \\frac{F_B - F_A}{k_BT}$$\n",
    "where $k_B$ is Boltzmann’s constant that relates thermal energy to the temperature ($k_B = 1.38·10^{-23}$ J/K), and $T$ is the temperature. We could, in principle, calculate a free energy difference by observing the system long enough, and measuring how often the system is in which state (i.e. measuring probabilities $p_A$ and $p_B$). The free energy differences, however, are often of the order of tens of kJ/mol. For example, the free energy of solvation of ethanol at 298K is -20.1 kJ/mol, which is equivalent to -8.1 $k_BT$ or to a relative probability of being in one of the states of $3·10^{-4}$. We would need to wait a long time for that transition to occur spontaneously, and even longer to get good statistics on it.\n",
    "To shorten the time needed for convergence, free energy methods rely on one basic idea: to force the system to where it doesn’t want to be, and then measure by how much it doesn’t want to be there. In potential of mean force, we apply mechanical force to decouple ligand and receptor. In free energy perturbation methods, we transform the system through a set of unphysical (alchemical) states, that connect two physical states we are interested in. To do so, the interaction strength between a molecule of interest and the rest of the system is coupled to a variable $\\lambda$:\n",
    "$$ E_{total} = E_{ligand-ligand} + E_{rest-rest} + \\lambda E_{ligand-rest}  $$\n",
    "and we slowly turn $\\lambda$ from 1 to 0. This means we can effectively turn off a ligand, and pretend that it is no longer coupled to a system (at $\\lambda=0$). This way we force the system to where it does not want to be (either to the solvated or to the vacuum state, depending on what the sign of the free energy difference is). We then use the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method of calculating the free energy difference between these to states (which is a measure of \"how much it does not want to be there\")."

    "After calculating the free energy of solvation, we’ve solved the first part of the free energy of binding of the earlier equations. The second part involves coupling a molecule into (or out of) a situation where it is bound to a protein. This introduces one additional complexity: we end up with a situation where a weakly coupled ligand wanders through our system:\n",
    "![weak-couple.png](./images/weak-couple.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "This situation can be remedied by forcing the ligand to stay at a specific position relative to the protein. This can be done with the GROMACS ‘pull code’, which allows the specification of arbitrary forces or constraints onto with respect to centers of mass of any chosen set of atoms onto any other group of atoms. With a pull type of ‘umbrella’, we can specify that we want a quadratic potential to this specified location, forcing the ligand to stay at its native position even when it has been fully de-coupled.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way find out where to put the center of the force is by choosing a group of atoms in the protein close to the ligand, and doing a simulation with full ligand coupling, where the pull code is enabled, but with zero force. The pull code will then frequently output the coordinates of the ligand, from which an average position and an expected deviation can be calculated. This can then serve as a reference point for the location of the center of force for the pull code during the production runs, and the force constant of the pull code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the free energy has been calculated, care must be taken to correct for the fact that we have trapped our molecule. This can easily be done analytically.\n",
